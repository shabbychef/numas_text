Write the general form of the iterated solution to the problem
\(\Mtx{A}\vect{x} = \vect{b}.\)
Let \Mtx{Q} be your ``splitting matrix,'' and use the factor $\omega.$
Your solution should look something like:
\[??\thex{k} =  ?? \thex{k-1} + ??\qquad\text{or}\qquad
 \thex{k} =  ?? \thex{k-1} + ?? \]

For one of the following variants, describe what \Mtx{Q} is, in relation to
\Mtx{A} : Richardson's, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel.

Devise a subroutine that, given an input number $z,$ calculates an approximate
to $\sqrt[3]{z}$ via Newton's Method.  Write your subroutine in pseudo code,
Matlab, or C/C++.  Include reasonable termination conditions so your subroutine
will terminate if it finds a good approximate solution.
Your subroutine should use only the basic arithmetic operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division; in particular your subroutine should not
have access to a cubed root or logarithm operator.

Consider the ODE:
\[\begin{cases}  x'(t) = \cos\Parens{x(t)} + \sin\Parens{x(t)} &\\
x(0) = 1\end{cases}\]
Use Taylor's theorem to devise a \bigo{h^3} approximant to $x(t+h)$ which is a
function of $x,\,t,$ and $h$ only.  
You may write your answer as a program:
\begin{align*}
x'(t) &\leftarrow Q_0(x(t))\\
x''(t) &\leftarrow Q_1(x(t),x'(t))\\
&\vdots\\
\tilde{x} &\leftarrow R(x(t),x'(t),x''(t),\ldots)
\end{align*}
such that
$x(t+h) = \tilde{x} + \bigo{h^3}.$
