\chapter{Partial Differential Equations by Finite Element Method}\label{chap:fem}

Ordinary Differential Equations, or ODEs, are used in approximating some
physical systems.  Some classical uses include simulation of the growth of
populations and trajectory of a particle.  They are usually easier to solve or
approximate than the more general Partial Differential Equations, PDEs, which
can contain partial derivatives.

Much of the background material of this chapter should be familiar to the
student of calculus.  We will focus more on the approximation of solutions,
than on analytical solutions.  For more background on ODEs, see any of the
standard texts, \eg \cite{Sjcalc5}.
